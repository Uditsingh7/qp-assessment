# Grocery Booking System

## Overview

The Grocery Booking System is a backend web application built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, Docker, and PostgreSQL. It aims to provide a robust solution for managing grocery orders, inventory, and user data efficiently.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing grocery items, orders, and user data.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes PostgreSQL as the database management system for storing and managing data.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Enables seamless deployment and scalability using Docker containers.
- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript to enhance code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing grocery items, orders, and users.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure system stability and reliability.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes Jest test cases to ensure the correctness of application logic and behavior.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to improve developer productivity and code quality.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful open-source relational database management system used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform that simplifies the deployment and management of applications.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Promise-based Node.js ORM for PostgreSQL, providing easy database management through JavaScript objects.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for Node.js applications, used for writing and executing unit tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd grocery-booking-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Use API endpoints to interact with the system for managing grocery items, orders, and user data.
2. Explore the codebase to understand the application structure, routes, controllers, models, and database interactions.
3. Run Jest test cases to ensure the correctness of application logic and behavior:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Customize and extend the application to fit your specific requirements, adding new features or modifying existing ones as needed.
